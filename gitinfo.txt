git status = tells you what you've changed (obviously)

To stop tracking a file you need to remove it from the index. This can be achieved with this command.
git rm --cached <file>

If you want to remove a whole folder, you need to remove all files in it recursively
git rm -r --cached <folder>

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
git init -b main

Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
git add .

Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
git commit -m "First commit"

At the top of your repository on GitHub.com's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.

$ git remote add origin  <REMOTE_URL> 
# Sets the new remote

$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL

$ git push origin main
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin


unstage added file
(use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
